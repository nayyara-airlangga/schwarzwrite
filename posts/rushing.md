Hello all, how are you guys doing? Recently, I've been studying a lot regarding web development because I'm interested in it and I have some experience in front-end development for mobile apps. So, for the past week I "rushed" learning everything starting from the fundamental HTML, CSS, Javascript. Then I started learning about the libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery, though I didn't really use them a lot. Then, I kinda got into the back-end and learnt Node.js and Express. 

Both were a lotta fun and I like it a lot. I learnt about the SQL database type and the NoSQL which I've used before in Firebase. I was about to take it easy, but then something came up. I have to get used to using Next, Typescript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. All of these I've never learnt before except Firebase. I also have less than 2 weeks to do so and create a basic chat app. Needless to say, I rushed again and learnt all of it starting from React since I havent learnt that. I kinda got used to Typescript and Next already (still far from being proficient though). And so here I am.

All I can say is, learn at your own pace. I'm definitely not good enough yet, but I can say that it's possible to learn it quick. Just gotta put in the work, the time and the miles in. Of course, prioritize what's important first. I hope you guys aren't bored to sleep by this post ahahaha. I just wanted to write so thanks for reading it. Hope you all have a nice day.
